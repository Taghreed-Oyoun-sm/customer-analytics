## Docker Image
🐳 **View on Docker Hub:** [taghreedoyoun/customer-analytics](https://hub.docker.com/r/taghreedoyoun/customer-analytics)

To pull the image directly:
```bash
docker pull taghreedoyoun/customer-analytics:latest
```

---

## Dataset
- **Name:** Online Retail II
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Link:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii
- **Description:** Raw transactional data from a UK-based online retail company (2009–2011), containing invoices, products, quantities, prices, and customer IDs.

---

## What Farah Implemented
- **Dockerfile** — Base image `python:3.11-slim`, installs all required packages, sets up `/app/pipeline/` as working directory
- **ingest.py** — Downloads the Online Retail II dataset from UCI, extracts the Excel file from the zip, and saves it as `data_raw.csv`
- **preprocess.py** — Full preprocessing pipeline:
  - *Data Cleaning:* removes duplicates, drops cancelled invoices, drops rows with missing Customer ID, filters invalid quantities/prices
  - *Feature Transformation:* creates `TotalAmount`, encodes `Country`, extracts date features (Year, Month, DayOfWeek), scales numeric columns with StandardScaler
  - *Dimensionality Reduction:* applies PCA (2 components) on Quantity, Price, TotalAmount
  - *Discretization:* bins `TotalAmount` into 5 categories and `Quantity` into 4 categories

## What Taghreed Implemented
- **analytics.py** — Generates 3 textual insights from the preprocessed data:
  - `insight1.txt`: Total revenue and number of unique customers
  - `insight2.txt`: Top 5 countries by revenue
  - `insight3.txt`: Average order value and most frequent purchase day
- **visualize.py** — Generates 3 meaningful plots saved as `summary_plot.png`:
  - Histogram of transaction amounts (excluding top 5% outliers)
  - Horizontal bar chart of top 10 countries by number of transactions
  - Correlation heatmap of numeric features
- **cluster.py** — Applies K-Means clustering (k=5) using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features, labels each cluster, and saves results to `clusters.txt`
- **summary.sh** — Builds the Docker image, runs the full pipeline inside the container, copies all outputs to `results/` on the host, then stops and removes the container

## Execution Flow

```
ingest.py
   └──> preprocess.py
            └──> analytics.py
                     └──> visualize.py
                               └──> cluster.py
```

Each script automatically calls the next one using `subprocess.call()`.

## Docker Build & Run Commands

### Option A — Run everything with one command (recommended)
```bash
bash summary.sh
```
This automatically builds the image, runs the full pipeline inside the container, copies all results to `results/`, and removes the container.

### Option B — Run manually step by step

**1. Build the Docker image**
```bash
docker build -t customer-analytics .
```

**2. Run the container and execute the pipeline**
```bash
docker run --name analytics-container customer-analytics python ingest.py
```

**3. Copy results to host and clean up**
```bash
bash summary.sh
```

### clusters.txt

> **Note on cluster selection:** Although the Elbow Method suggested k=2 as the optimal number of clusters, the resulting segmentation was not meaningful, as it mainly separated a small group of extreme high-value customers from the rest. To obtain more interpretable and actionable customer segments, a higher number of clusters (k=5) was selected. This allowed better differentiation between customer behaviors such as regular, occasional, high-value, and churned customers.
